Nested Layer Manager 2 provides the ability to nest layers in 3ds Max. This tool is small, fast and allows layers to be nested in an unlimited number of folders.

It has complete 2 way communication with the default layer manager. If anything is altered in either, both layer managers are updated. This allows people without this script installed to still see the normal layer organisation present in the file.

TO INSTALL:
1. Add all contents of mzp folder to a compressed zip file. (Do NOT include the mzp folder)
2. Rename file extension of zip file to .mzp (MaxScript Zip  - Custom 3ds Max Installer file format)
3. Drag the file into the 3ds Max viewport, or choose MaxScript > Run Script.
